# musicalChairs
This is a program, that plays wav music files, and will automatically pause them the purpose of this program is so that there is no need for someone to pause the music for the game the computer will do it automatically. Some one is only needed to start the song and choose a song which I figure can be easily automated if some one wanted, those aspects to also be automated.
# Installing
Either just compile the code and create your own jar file through your IDE or download the jar file in the out\artifacts\musicalChairs_jar, when the progrma is ran for the first time it should prompt the user to locate the directory of their wav files. Once that is located you can just double click a song to begin the game, after that when the computer pauses the game just press play to continue the game.
# Built With
mainly the Java Swing API, File API, various listener API, javasound API, and more standard java APIs.
# Acknowledgements
Thanks to the Learn java reddit community, as this is my first java and OOP project and I had to ask a lot of questions, and try a lot of things they were there to help me understand the way the language works and now I am much better off than when I began learning Java.
